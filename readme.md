# Jonathan Cox
I'm a fullstack developer based out of Northern Virginia (currently) with over 8 years experience. 

## Development Site & Blog
This is the repository for my personal site, eventually a blog, and who knows what else. I've open-sourced the code for others to learn from or just in case someone is curious and wants take a look under the hood.
